Yakr is yet another IRC bot. This one is designed to be very thin, with the same plugability of Superbot and Superbot2.

This requires the gevent package to be installed. (http://www.gevent.org/)

To start the bot:
python Main.py

During the process of creating plugins it may be useful to attempt to load plugins, to make sure they initialize.
python Main.py PluginTest
will create the plugin manager that Yakr uses, and attempt to load everything in the same way that Yakr uses. 
WARNING: any actions that are fired won't work as there's no associated bot.
